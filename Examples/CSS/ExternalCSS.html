        <h1>External CSS</h1>
        <p>Once you start adding a lot of styles to a web page, they quickly start to become difficult to read</p>
        <p>To make this easier to manage, styles can be in a different file and linked to the HTML document</p>
        <p>To do this, a HTML LINK tag is put at the top of the page - &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/file.css" /&gt;</p>
        <p>When the browser encounters the LINK tag, it will load the file and apply all of the styles in it</p>
        <p><span>Similar to the Introduction page, this text is in a span tag</span></p>
        <p><span id="cat">This text is in a span with an ID of cat</span></p>
        <p><span class="cat">This text is in a span with a class of cat</span></p>
    </body>
