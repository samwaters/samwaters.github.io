        <p>There are many different HTML tags, but they all share the same basic premise</p>
        <p>A tag has a few different components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They are denoted by angle brackets: &lt; &gt;</li>
            <li>The tag name, e.g. p or h1</li>
            <li>Any attributes, if applicable, that give the tag more details e.g. src="images/cat.jpg"</li>
            <li>Any content, for example the text in a paragraph</li>
            <li>The closing tag, which matches the opening tag except for a forward slash, e.g. &lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <li>Some tags are called short tags, and include the opening and closing tag together, e.g. &lt;img /&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some examples would include &lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt; and &lt;img src="images/cat.jpg" /&gt;</p>
