        <h1>JavaScript Introduction</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is code that runs after the web page has finished loading</p>
        <p>It can see all of the HTML elements on the page, and can interact with all of them</p>
        <p>It can also react to events from the user, such as mouse clicks and key presses</p>
        <p>JavaScript is placed into &lt;script&gt; tags at the bottom of the page</p>
        <div>
            <button id="button">Click Me</button>
            <span id="cat">You've not clicked the button yet</span>
        </div>
        <script>
            document.getElementById('button').onclick = () => {
                document.getElementById('cat').innerHTML = 'Well done, you clicked it'
            }
        </script>
    </body>
